Overview:
This version of Breakout will differ from the original
by including enemies that roam about each level and
attempt to attack the player's paddle with themselves
and projectiles, which would result in instant death
if collided with. Each level is completed when all blocks
are cleared.

Levels:
- Level 1: Basic block grid (4 rows of 10 blocks each,
           single-hit bricks and power-up bricks mixed)
- Level 2: Introduction of double-hit and unbreakable bricks
           mixed in with single-hit blocks in an oval shape.
- Level 3: All types of bricks mixed in the shape of a skull.

Types of blocks:
- Single hit block (only requires one hit to break)
- Double hit block (requires two hits to break)
- Power-up brick (contains power-up)
- Unbreakable brick (acts as immutable obstacle for ball)

Types of power-up:
- Multi-ball (spawns two additional balls, life is over
  when all three balls are lost)
- Sticky paddle - allows balls to stick to paddle and be
  released at will with a keystroke (1 at a time)
- Long paddle - Increases the length of the player paddle

Cheat keys:
Key 1: Extra life - Press F11 at any time
Key 2, 3, 4: Level select - press F1, F2, F3 at any time
             (F1 -> Lvl 1, F2 -> Lvl 2, F3 -> Lvl 3)

Extra addition:
The inclusion of enemies that move around the play area
will add a new layer of depth to the player experience.
The two types of enemies are planned to be:
- An enemy that flies in a zigzag pattern across the
screen
- An enemy that remains in a single location but launches
projectiles at certain intervals toward the player paddle
