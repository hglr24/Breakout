Each file should include:

    names of all people who worked on the file
    comment each class to describe its
        purpose (why would anyone use it)
        assumptions (what situations or values might cause it to fail)
        dependencies (what other classes or packages it depends on)
        an example of how to use it
        any other details users should know
    comment each public method (and especially abstract methods)
        purpose (why would anyone use it)
        assumptions (what situations or values might cause it to fail)
        parameters (purpose beyond their name if necessary)
        return value
    inline comments should be kept to a minimum (because the code should be readable on its own)
        comments should never simply restate the code, but always state its purpose
        code hacks, or other non-standard code, should be factored into a separate method and commented extensively
