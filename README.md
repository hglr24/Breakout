Added enemies to game to make it more interactive and lively:

### Notes
- Included three paddle enhancements that count toward overall
power-up requirement since specifications implied these enhancements
are power-ups if implemented as such.

### Impressions
- Design checklist and specification pages on CS308 website
give slightly conflicting information relating to power-up specifications,
 which confused me and ultimately led to a PLAN.txt file that lacked some 
 details in the full specification document.
